# RegEx Crossword Puzzle

This is a practice project: I made it to learn [ReactJS][0] on a non-trivial
but still small project. Hence it may not be the 'state of the art'.

I primarily focused on [React][0] and [modern JavaScript][1]. No styles, no
packaging, nothing else.


## The Puzzle

It's a [crossword][3] puzzle with a twist: the rows and columns are not to be
filled by answering a trivia-question, but by satisfying a [regular
expression][4]. Otherwise the rules are the same.


## Demo

There is a [demo site](https://mqrelly.github.io/regex-crossword-puzzle) with
a very basic puzzle to test out the component.


## License

Under the [GNU General Public License v3][5] (or see LICENSE.txt file).


## ToDo

- [ ] Organize files in `src/` directory.
- [x] Create a GitHub page for the project for instant demo
- [ ] Load a new puzzle from an URL (puzzle format JSON)
- [ ] Load a new puzzle from a JSON file
- [ ] Add Undo/redo capabilities
- [ ] Save/restore (half)filled out puzzles to/from LocalStorage.


The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App][2].
